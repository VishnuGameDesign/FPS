# UE5 FPS Movement Prototype

A first-person shooter movement prototype built in Unreal Engine 5.

## Features

ðŸŽ® **Titanfall 2-inspired movement:**
- Wall running (horizontal traversal on vertical surfaces)
- Wall jumping (momentum-based wall rebound)

## Goals

This project aims to replicate and experiment with advanced FPS movement mechanics seen in modern shooters, starting with Titanfall 2. The long-term goal is to build a flexible and modular system that supports additional parkour features.

## Notes

The project is still in early development. Movement logic is written in C++ with Blueprint support for prototyping and visualization.
